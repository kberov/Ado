NAME
  Ado::Manual - Getting started with Ado

SYNOPSIS
    ado daemon
    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000

DESCRIPTION
  Ado is a framework for web projects based on Mojolicious, written in the
  Perl programming language <http://www.perl.org/>.

  Ado is a typical well structured, MVC
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>
  Mojolicious application. It comes with default configuration and a model
  layer, plugged in by Mojolicious::Plugin::DSC. An SQLite database is
  bundled in the distribution at "etc/ado.sqlite" to get started quickly.

  Ado provides additional plugins and commands, which promote RAD
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development>, good
  practices, and team-work when starting new projects. The default Ado page
  uses Semantic UI <http://beta.semantic-ui.com/> via
  Mojolicious::Plugin::SemanticUI and is a good place to get acquainted.

INSTALLATION
  We strongly recommend using Ado with your own Perl (not the system-wide)!

  Ado can be *installed into any folder of your choice*. By default it goes
  into the "siteprefix" folder of your *non-system Perl distro*. When
  installing Ado in its own folder, you may want to add the
  "/path/to/yourAdo/bin" to your $PATH environment variable. When using Ado
  as a module from "/path/to/yourAdo/lib", add the path to $PERL5LIB.

  To install manually Ado after downloading, run the following commands:

    tar -zxf Ado-X.XX.tar.gz
    cd Ado-X.XX/
    perl Build.PL --install_base $HOME/opt/ado
    ./Build installdeps
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

  To see more installation methods and details, go to
  Ado::Manual::Installation.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
  After installing, you can find documentation with the perldoc command.

      perldoc Ado
      perldoc Ado::Manual #this page

  For better experience run the "ado" application and read the documentation
  from your browser.

    /path/to/yourAdo/bin/ado daemon

  If you installed "ado" in your Perl distro, you can simply type:

    ado daemon

  Go to http:/localhost:3000/perldoc

  You can report bugs and suggest features at
  <http://github.com/kberov/Ado/issues>. Bugs will be considered and fixed
  as time permits. Feel invited to make pull requests for your
  contributions.

CONTRIBUTING
  Anybody can contribute by reporting issues via github or fixing typos in
  the documentation. To be able to contribute with code, some rules need to
  be kept. This is mandatory for any community project. Generally the rules
  outlined in Mojolicious::Guides::Contributing apply for Ado too. For
  specific to Ado rules see Ado::Manual::Contributing.

  We expect that you know how Internet works, how to write Perl modules and
  are familiar with Mojolicious.

REST API
  Ado strives for strict separation of concerns. The best way to achieve
  this is to fully separate the client code from the server code. Ado is
  ideally suited for the purpose thanks to Mojolicious. Every resource is
  accessible via the REST API. We follow closely and elaborate on the
  recommendations in "RESTful Service Best Practices" at
  www.RestApiTutorial.com. See Ado::Manual::RESTAPI.

PLUGINS
  Ado plugins work the same way as Mojolicious::Plugins and share the same
  common base trough Ado::Plugin. Ado plugins have one small additional
  feature. They can load their own configuration from
  "$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/etc/plugins/plugin_name.conf". Business-specific
  applications for an Ado-based system are usually implemented as plugins.
  One way to contribute to Ado is by writing plugins.

  See Ado::Manual::Plugins and Ado::Plugin for more information.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
  We would like to know that our software is always in good health so we
  count on friendly developers and organizations to install and test it
  continuously.

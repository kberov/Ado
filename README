NAME
  Ado::Manual - Getting started with Ado

SYNOPSIS
    ado daemon
    Server available at http://127.0.0.1:3000

DESCRIPTION
  Ado is a framework and application for web-projects, based on Mojolicious,
  written in the Perl programming language <http://www.perl.org/>.

  Ado is a typical well structured, MVC
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>
  Mojolicious application. Ado is a base application for building on it a
  CMS, ERP, CRM or all of them integrated together.

  It comes with default configuration and a model layer Ado::Model, plugged
  in by Mojolicious::Plugin::DSC. An SQLite database is bundled with the
  distribution at "etc/ado.sqlite" to get started quickly.

  Ado provides additional plugins and commands, which promote RAD
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development>, good
  practices, and team-work when starting new projects. The default Ado page
  uses Semantic UI <http://semantic-ui.com/> via
  Mojolicious::Plugin::SemanticUI and is a good place to get acquainted.

  In short, Ado can be used right away as a CMS
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system> that can be
  extended with plugins and commands or as a CMF
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_content_management_frameworks> on
  which to build a specific application.

INSTALLATION
  We strongly recommend using Ado with your own Perl
  <https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-perlbrew/bin/perlbrew> (not the
  system-wide)! This will give you freedom to experiment with new versions
  and modules without polluting your system perl. Ado can be *installed into
  any folder of your choice*. By default it goes into the "siteprefix"
  folder of the perl distribution used for installation.

  When installing Ado in its own folder, you may want to add the
  "/path/to/yourAdo/bin" to your $PATH environment variable. When using Ado
  as a module from "/path/to/yourAdo/lib", add the path to $PERL5LIB.

  To install manually Ado after downloading, run the following commands:

    tar -zxf Ado-X.XX.tar.gz
    cd Ado-X.XX/
    perl Build.PL --install_base $HOME/opt/ado
    ./Build installdeps
    ./Build
    ./Build test #optional
    ./Build install

  To see more installation methods and details, go to
  Ado::Manual::Installation.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
  After installing, you can find documentation with the perldoc command.

      perldoc Ado
      perldoc Ado::Manual #this page

  For better experience run the "ado" application and read the documentation
  from your browser.

    /path/to/yourAdo/bin/ado daemon

  If you installed "ado" in your Perl distro, you can simply type:

    ado daemon

  Go to http:/localhost:3000/perldoc

  You can report bugs and suggest features at
  <http://github.com/kberov/Ado/issues>. Bugs will be considered and fixed
  as time permits. Feel invited to make pull requests for your
  contributions.

  If you are simply looking for help with using Ado, please ask your
  questions at <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ado-dev>.

CONTRIBUTING
  Anybody can contribute by reporting issues via github or fixing typos in
  the documentation. To be able to contribute with code, some rules need to
  be kept. This is mandatory for any community project. Generally the rules
  outlined in Mojolicious::Guides::Contributing apply for Ado too. For
  specific to Ado rules see Ado::Manual::Contributing.

  We expect that you know how Internet works, how to write Perl modules and
  are familiar with Mojolicious.

  To ease discusssions on Ado further development, a forum was created.
  <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ado-dev>.

REST API
  Ado strives for strict separation of concerns. The best way to achieve
  this is to fully separate the client code from the server code. Ado is
  ideally suited for the purpose thanks to Mojolicious. Every
  resource(route) is accessible via a browser as "/path/to/resourse" an
  returns HTML or using "/path/to/resourse.json" and returns JSON. We follow
  closely and elaborate on the recommendations in "RESTful Service Best
  Practices" at www.RestApiTutorial.com. See Ado::Manual::RESTAPI.

PLUGINS
  Business-specific applications for an Ado-based system are usually
  implemented as plugins. One way to contribute to Ado is by writing
  plugins.

  Ado plugins work the same way as Mojolicious::Plugins and share the same
  common base trough Ado::Plugin which ISA Mojolicious::Plugins. Ado plugins
  have one small additional feature. They can load their own configuration
  from "$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/etc/plugins/plugin_name.conf".

  See Ado::Manual::Plugins and Ado::Plugin for more information.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
  We would like to know that our software is always in good health. We count
  on friendly developers and organizations to install and test it
  continuously.

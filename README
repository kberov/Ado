NAME
  Ado::Manual - Developers' manual

DESCRIPTION
  Ado is a light on dependencies framework and application for web-projects,
  based on Mojolicious, written in the Perl programming language
  <http://www.perl.org/>. Ado is a typical well structured, MVC
  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>
  Mojolicious application. It aims to allow teams to build on it a CMS, ERP,
  CRM or all of them integrated together.

  Please note that the project is still a work-in-progress. Parts of it
  work, others are simply missing.

GETTING STARTED
  *   Start a personal blog with Ado::Manual::FiveMinutes if you are
      impatient.

  *   Read the Ado::Manual::Intro for a general overview.

  *   To see different installation methods, go to
      Ado::Manual::Installation.

  *   To learn about plugins and how to write your own plugin, see
      Ado::Manual::Plugins.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION
  After installing, you can find documentation with the perldoc command.

          perldoc Ado
          perldoc Ado::Manual #this page

  For better experience run the "ado" application and read the documentation
  from your browser.

          /path/to/yourAdo/bin/ado daemon

  If you installed "ado" in your Perl distro, you can simply type:

          ado daemon

  Go to http:/localhost:3000/perldoc

  You can report bugs and suggest features at
  <http://github.com/kberov/Ado/issues>. Bugs will be considered and fixed
  as time permits. Feel invited to make pull requests for your
  contributions.

  If you are simply looking for help with using Ado, please ask your
  questions at <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ado-dev>.

CONTRIBUTING
  Anybody can contribute by reporting issues via github or fixing typos in
  the documentation. To be able to contribute with code, some rules need to
  be kept. This is mandatory for any community project. Generally the rules
  outlined in Mojolicious::Guides::Contributing apply for Ado too. For
  specific to Ado rules see Ado::Manual::Contributing.

  We expect that you know how Internet works, how to write Perl modules and
  are familiar with Mojolicious.

  To ease discussions on Ado further development, a forum was created.
  <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ado-dev>.

REST API
  Ado strives for strict separation of concerns. The best way to achieve
  this is to fully separate the client code from the server code. Ado is
  ideally suited for the purpose thanks to Mojolicious. Every
  resource(route) is accessible via a browser as "/path/to/resourse" an
  returns HTML or using "/path/to/resourse.json" and returns JSON. We follow
  closely and elaborate on the recommendations in "RESTful Service Best
  Practices" at <http://www.RestApiTutorial.com>. See Ado::Manual::RESTAPI.

PLUGINS
  Business-specific applications for an Ado-based system are usually
  implemented as plugins. One way to contribute to Ado is by writing
  plugins.

  Ado plugins work the same way as Mojolicious::Plugins and share the same
  common base trough Ado::Plugin which ISA Mojolicious::Plugins. Ado plugins
  have one small additional feature. They can load their own configuration
  from "$ENV{MOJO_HOME}/etc/plugins/plugin_name.conf".

  See Ado::Manual::Plugins and Ado::Plugin for more information.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
  We would like to know that our software is always in good health. We count
  on friendly developers and organizations to install and test it
  continuously.
